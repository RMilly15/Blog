		<p>Konnichiwa, Buanas Dias, and Good Afternoon my name is Milly Rachel. To be completely honest i'm not to sure what i am doing right now<br>
Then again who is, that sounded extremely Disney. Fuck so did that ... well that didn't. Ugh I was trying to type correctly but that takes to long and my brain thinks to fast.<br>
Its been awhile since I have coded anything but now that i'm in a new house with a computer I thought what is a better way to pass the time then to go back to what i love, or at 
least used to love to do at one point. <br> 
Most likely my code right now is really basic that's because I need to refresh my memory on how to do this actually I'm pretty sure right now my code is horrible and i can already see the error
 in my code, but fuck it.<br> Honestly,
who actually gives a shit. When you're a teen like I am (age 14) most likely I would think that everyone gives a shit what i'm doing right now.<br> But I was raised differently then most teens of
 my generations I can see right through this teen
bullshit, I like to surround myself with other teens who see through it to. Like ... well I can think of one other person but I guess just like Real recognizes Real , <br>Real can also recognize
 fake ass shit. Ha I cuss a lot now that i'm typing it all out.
I'm also noticing how much faster it is to type when you're not doing it correctly, actually nevermind i keep making mistakes.<br> Any ways why do you give a shit honestly you don't im just bored
 and can't even remeber how to 
publish this so no one is reading this also I'll most likely delete this entire thing because of how cringe worthy my words are.<br> You know what it would be pretty funny if I became some kind 
of blogger because of this,
That's not such a bae, dammit baf , fuck BAD idea . Maybe... I'll give it some thought I have nothing to type about and i'm horrible
at staying on topic.Fuck it i'll do whatever the fuck I want. As long as my mom says it's okay ... well even then sometimes I don't listen, damn I need to go back to church.<br>
Well until my next thought
